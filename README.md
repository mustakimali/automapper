# automapper
A convention based object-object mapper for Rust. This uses Json rustdoc generated by `cargo doc`.

See examples in `crates/usage/tests`.

## To Do
- [x] Basic struct + primitive fields
- [x] Optional fields
- [ ] Struct mapping: tuple fields
- [ ] Enum mapping
- [ ] Issue when moving tests outside crate
- [ ] Impl foreign trait for struct
